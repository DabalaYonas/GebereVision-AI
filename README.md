# GebereVision-AI
Welcome to the GebereVision AI Github repository! GebereVision AI is AI-driven platform that combines smart irrigation, crop disease detection, yield prediction, precision fertilization, livestock health monitoring, climate-resilient crop recommendations, supply chain optimization, and market price prediction. 

## Structure
This repository is structured as follows:
- `frontend/`: Here, you will find the frontend code for the GebereVision AI platform, implemented using JavaScript, React, and Axios. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code of the GebereVision AI platform, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Django framework and Django REST Framework.
- `models/`: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models used by GebereVision AI to enhance the platform's capabilities. The models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries, and they play a crucial role in predict soil moisture levels based, Identify crop diseases from images, forecast crop yields using historical data, forecast agricultural market prices, etc.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the GebereVision AI platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models Power GebereVision AI
GebereVision AI leverages the integration of multiple AI models to different services (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, Dalle-3, etc.), to create an AI-powered smart farm management system to optimize agricultural operations, enhance productivity, and promote sustainability.. Key features include:
- Simplified and user-friendly interface
- Using cloud-based machine learning platforms and optimizing algorithms for efficient training and deployment.
- Implementing scalable data streaming and real-time analytics.
- Developing comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines to handle discrepancies and improve data quality.
